# Prepare the dataset

If you have downloaded the MIMIC-CXR dataset mentioned in [/data/README.md](../../../data), you don't need to download this link (51 GB): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TZkTeHRDtwQN8vdRxMgii30r_QMo7I_b/view

You can symlink `images512` here at `baselines/RM_MCLN/data/images512`.

Finally, you should have the following structure:

```
RM_MCLN/data
- images512
- annotation_ours2.json
```
